# Video_rental_management_system
Created a video rental GUI and use a binary tree to traverse and sort the videos.

This Video Rental Management System was the first project we did in the class Data Structures 
There is a simple GUI for the user to sort by name, date, and amount left. The user can also search for the videos by name.
